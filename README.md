# LLM
Transfomer-based language model.
 
Pretrained on Fineweb-edu (~15b tokens) and BAAI/CCI4.0-M2-CoT-v1 (~2B tokens)
Finetuned on various questions from datasets like Ultrachat, Google Natural Questions, and Smoltalk. Answers were generated by Qwen3:8b.

Here is the best model so far (505m parameters):

## To run:
1. Download the model from google drive.
2. Download the code in this repository
3. In chat_transformer.py, change the path of the model and tokenizer to where you saved the files
4. Run chat_transformer.py

## To finetune:
1. Change path in the dataloader to the path of your dataset
2. Finetune
### Note: If you run out of memory, use transformer_model_llama_june2025_checkpointing. It is slower but uses around 30% less memory
